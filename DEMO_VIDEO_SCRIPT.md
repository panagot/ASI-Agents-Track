### **3. Live Demo (1:30 - 4:30)**

#### **Part A: Web Interface Demo (1:30 - 2:30)**

**[Screen: Web application at localhost:8000]**

**Narrator:** "Let me show you our web interface in action. Here we have a patient case analysis system."

**[Action: Fill in patient form]**
- Patient ID: P001
- Age: 65
- Gender: Male
- Symptoms: "chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, sweating"
- Medical History: "diabetes, hypertension"
- Current Medications: "metformin, lisinopril"

**[Action: Click "Analyze Patient"]**

**Narrator:** "When I click analyze, our AI agents collaborate in real-time to process this patient data."

**[Screen: Results display]**
- "The system shows symptom categorization by body system"
- "Diagnoses with confidence scores - Myocardial Infarction at 100% confidence"
- "Treatment recommendations including medications and lifestyle changes"
- "Risk assessment showing high priority level"
- "Clear next steps for healthcare professionals"

#### **Part B: Agent Communication Demo (2:30 - 3:30)**

**[Screen: Agent collaboration flow]**

**Narrator:** "Behind the scenes, multiple specialized agents are working together:"

**[Screen: Agent architecture diagram]**
- "Symptom Analyzer processes and categorizes symptoms"
- "Diagnosis Specialist uses medical knowledge to suggest diagnoses"
- "Treatment Planner recommends evidence-based treatments"
- "Risk Assessment evaluates patient risk and urgency"
- "Care Coordinator orchestrates the collaboration"

**[Screen: Real agent code]**

**Narrator:** "Each agent is built using the uAgents framework with Chat Protocol integration, making them discoverable through ASI:One."

#### **Part C: ASI:One Integration Demo (3:30 - 4:30)**

**[Screen: ASI:One interface]**

**Narrator:** "Our agents are also accessible through ASI:One. Let me demonstrate natural language interaction."

**[Action: Type in ASI:One]**
"Analyze patient with chest pain and shortness of breath"

**[Screen: Agent response]**
- "The agent responds with comprehensive medical analysis"
- "Natural language processing handles conversational queries"
- "Structured data processing for clinical accuracy"

**[Action: Show structured data example]**
"PATIENT_DATA: {patient information in JSON format}"

**[Screen: Detailed analysis response]**
- "The agent processes structured medical data"
- "Provides detailed diagnosis with confidence scores"
- "Includes treatment recommendations and risk assessment"
