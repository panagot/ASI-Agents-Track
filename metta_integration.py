"""
Optional MeTTa integration stub for ASI Alliance grant compliance.

This module exposes a single function `query_metta_knowledge(term)` that returns a
structured snippet. If MeTTa runtime is available in the environment, you can
replace the internals to execute a real MeTTa query.

The main agent imports this safely and treats failures as no-op to avoid
deployment issues on Agentverse.
